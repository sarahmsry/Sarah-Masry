<h1>Simple Homemade Ramen Recipe</h1>

<div class = "textBlock">
<h2>Ingredients List</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minced Onions: Makes the broth nice and savory!</li>
<li>Sliced Mushrooms: Regular brown mushrooms work great here! You can also use shiitake mushrooms.</li>
<li>Chicken Stock: Chicken broth is typically what I have on hand and great for a savory soup base. If you want your ramen to have more of the classic Tonkotsu flavor, use pork broth instead. You can also use vegetable broth as a vegetarian/vegan alternative.</li>
<li>Water: Adjusts the consistency of the ramen soup.</li>
<li>Soy Sauce: Add a splash for savory flavor!</li>
<li>Instant Ramen Noodles: You only want the uncooked noodles. Throw out those seasoning packets! You can also use fresh ramen noodles if you can find them.</li>
<li>Salt and Pepper: Add to taste.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1 - Soft Boil some Eggs</h2>
<p>Heat the water. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, so the water maintains a gentle boil.<br>
Then, add the eggs. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower the eggs into the simmering water. Set a timer for 7 minutes.<br>
Fill a large bowl with cold water, and add a handful of ice. When the timer goes off, remove the eggs from the hot water, and immediately add them to the ice bath. Allow them to chill for at least 3 minutes.<br>
Finally, peel the eggs! Tap the bottom of a soft boiled egg to remove a little of the shell. Carefully slide a small spoon between the egg and its shell, and slide it around the egg to loosen the shell and remove it.</p>

<h2>Step 2 - Boil Noodles</h2>
<p> Remove the pot from the heat. Then place the ramen noodles in the hot pot of broth. Allow the noodles to sit for ONLY a couple of minutes until they loosen and soften up. The noodles will soften quickly, so this should be done right before serving. </p>
